### Angular

---

### `What is a Component ?`
---

Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app. An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components.

---

### `How can I display data ?`

---

You can display data by binding controls in an HTML template to properties of an Angular component.

code={require("raw-loader!./src/app/demos/life-cycle-hooks.ts")}
steps={[
  {range: [9, 17]},
]}
/>
---

### `Updating them`
Angular executes template expressions after every change detection cycle. Change detection cycles are triggered by many asynchronous activities such as promise resolutions, HTTP results, timer events, key presses and mouse moves.

---


### `About best practices:`
Although it's possible to write complex template expressions, it's a better practice to avoid them.

---

### `But what are template statements ?`
A template statement has a side effect. That's the whole point of an event. It's how you update application state from user action.

---

---

### `Lifecycle Hooks`
Angular offers lifecycle hooks that provide visibility into these key life moments and the ability to act when they occur.

---

### Hooks and Sequence
`ngOnChanges()`, `ngOnInit()`, `ngDoCheck()`, `ngAfterContentInit()`, `ngAfterContentChecked()`, `ngAfterViewInit()`, `ngAfterViewChecked()`, `ngOnDestroy()`

  {range: [19, 25], notes: "Hooks implementation."},

  {range: [38, 43], notes: "ngOnInit"},
  {range: [44, 59], notes: "All others"},
  {range: [59, 62], notes: "OnDestroy"},

---
### Component Interaction
Pass data from parent to child with input binding.
Use ``@Input decorator``.

---
### Component Interaction
Parent listens for child event.
Use ``@Output decorator``.

<CodeSurfer

dark="false"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/app/demos/after-view-init.ts")}
steps={[
  {range: [18, 28], notes: "Input, Output and 2 more."},
  {range: [27, 37], notes: "ViewChild and local variable"}

---
<CodeSurfer
title="Component that subscribes."
dark="false"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/app/demos/component-interaction.ts")}
/>

---
### Component Styles
The styles specified in @Component metadata apply only within the template of that component.

---
Changes to styles elsewhere in the application don't affect the component's styles.

---
You can co-locate the CSS code of each component with the TypeScript and HTML code of the component, which leads to a neat and tidy project structure.

---
You can change or remove component CSS code without searching through the whole application to find where else the code is used.

## `Pipes`
A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output
