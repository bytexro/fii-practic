# RxJS
## What is it?

```notes
Developed by Microsoft, in collaboration with a community of open source developers,
RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array(map, filter, reduce, every, etc)
to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
```

<CodeSurfer
title="Observer"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/observer.es6")}

  {range: [1, 18], notes: 'Observable'},
  {range: [1, 1], notes: ''},
  {range: [2, 17], notes: ''},

  {range: [13, 15], notes: ''},
  {range: [21, 25], notes: ''},

<CodeSurfer
title="Observer"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/real-world-observer.es6")}
steps={[
  { range: [0, 3], notes: "Pure Javascript 'click' Event" },
  { range: [5, 9], notes: "RxJS 'click' Event" },
]}
/>

## Subject

```notes
A Subject is like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers. Subjects are like EventEmitters they maintain a registry of many listeners
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="Subject"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/subject.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "Create a new Subject" },
  { lines: [3], notes: "First subscription" },
  { lines: [4], notes: "Second subscription" },
  { lines: [6], notes: "Emit first event" },
  { lines: [3, 6, 7, 8] },
  { lines: [4, 6, 7, 9] },
  { lines: [11], notes: "Emit second event" },
  { lines: [3, 11, 12, 13] },
  { lines: [4, 11, 12, 14] },
]}
/>
---
## Behavior Subject

```notes
One of the variants of Subjects is the BehaviorSubject, which has a notion of "the current value".
It stores the latest value emitted to its consumers, and whenever a new Observer subscribes, it will immediately receive the "current value" from the BehaviorSubject
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="Behavior Subject"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/behavior-subject.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "Create a new BehaviorSubject" },
  { lines: [3], notes: "First subscription" },
  { lines: [3, 4, 5]},
  { lines: [7], notes: "Emit first event" },
  { lines: [3, 7, 8, 9] },
  { lines: [11], notes: "Emit second event" },
  { lines: [3, 11, 12, 13] },
  { lines: [15], notes: "Second subscription" },
  { lines: [11, 15, 16, 17]},
  { lines: [19], notes: "Emit last event" },
  { lines: [3, 19, 20, 21] },
  { lines: [15, 19, 20, 22] },
]}
/>

## Operators

```notes
What are operators?
Operators are methods on the Observable type, such as .map, .filter, .merge, etc.
When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance.
Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the rst Observable.
```
---
### `map`

```notes
map is a pretty simple operator. It takes a projection function, and applies it to each value that comes from the source observable.
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="map Operator"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/map.es6")}
steps={[
  { range: [1, 6] },
  { range: [1, 7] },
  { range: [7, 9] },
  { range: [1, 10] },
]}
/>
---
### `filter`

```notes
filter operator is self-explanatory
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="filter Operator"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/filter.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1] },
  { lines: [3] },
  { lines: [5] },
  { range: [1, 9] }
]}
/>
---
### `find`

```notes
Searches for an element that matches the conditions defined by the specified predicate,
and returns the first occurrence within the entire Observable sequence.
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="find Operator"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/find.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1] },
  { range: [3, 4] },
  { lines: [6] },
  { range: [1, 9] }
]}
/>
---
### `pipe`

```notes
pipe is a method on Observable which is used for composing operators.
pipe was introduced to RxJS in v5.5
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="pipe Method"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/pipe.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "take this code" },
  { range: [3, 6], notes: "turn it into this" },
  { range: [1, 6] }
]}
/>
---
### `pipe` Benefits

 * cleans up Observable.prototype by removing operators
 * makes the RxJS library more tree-shakeable
 * makes it easier to write and use third-party operators
