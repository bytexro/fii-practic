# Promises

---

"Imagine you are a kid. Your mom promises you that she'll get you a new phone next week."

You don't know if you will get that phone until next week. Your mom can either really buy you a brand new phone, or stand you up and withhold the phone if she is not happy :(.

---

That is a promise. A promise has 3 states. They are:

Pending: You don't know if you will get that phone
Fulfilled: Mom is happy, she buys you a brand new phone
Rejected: Your mom is happy, she withholds the phone

ES7 introduce async and await syntax. It makes the asynchronous syntax look prettier and easier to understand, without the .then and .catch.

# Why promises ?

---
If you add the numbers with normal function, you get the result immediately. However when you issue a remote call to get result, you need to wait, you can't get the result immediately.

```notes
Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.

# RxJS
## What is it?
<img src='./assets/Rx_Logo_S.png' />

```notes
Developed by Microsoft, in collaboration with a community of open source developers,
RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array(map, filter, reduce, every, etc)
to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
```

  { range: [5, 9], notes: "RxJS 'click' Event" },
]}
/>
---
## Subject

```notes
A Subject is like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers. Subjects are like EventEmitters they maintain a registry of many listeners
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="Subject"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/subject.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "Create a new Subject" },
  { lines: [3], notes: "First subscription" },
  { lines: [4], notes: "Second subscription" },
  { lines: [6], notes: "Emit first event" },
  { lines: [3, 6, 7, 8] },
  { lines: [4, 6, 7, 9] },
  { lines: [11], notes: "Emit second event" },
  { lines: [3, 11, 12, 13] },
  { lines: [4, 11, 12, 14] },
]}
/>
---
## Behavior Subject

```notes
One of the variants of Subjects is the BehaviorSubject, which has a notion of "the current value".
It stores the latest value emitted to its consumers, and whenever a new Observer subscribes, it will immediately receive the "current value" from the BehaviorSubject
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="Behavior Subject"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/behavior-subject.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "Create a new BehaviorSubject" },
  { lines: [3], notes: "First subscription" },
  { lines: [3, 4, 5]},
  { lines: [7], notes: "Emit first event" },
  { lines: [3, 7, 8, 9] },
  { lines: [11], notes: "Emit second event" },
  { lines: [3, 11, 12, 13] },
  { lines: [15], notes: "Second subscription" },
  { lines: [11, 15, 16, 17]},
  { lines: [19], notes: "Emit last event" },
  { lines: [3, 19, 20, 21] },
  { lines: [15, 19, 20, 22] },
]}
/>

## Operators

```notes
What are operators?
Operators are methods on the Observable type, such as .map, .filter, .merge, etc.
When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance.
Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the rst Observable.
```
---
### `map`

```notes
map is a pretty simple operator. It takes a projection function, and applies it to each value that comes from the source observable.
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="map Operator"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/map.es6")}
steps={[
  { range: [1, 6] },
  { range: [1, 7] },
  { range: [7, 9] },
  { range: [1, 10] },
]}
/>
---
### `filter`

```notes
filter operator is self-explanatory
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="filter Operator"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/filter.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1] },
  { lines: [3] },
  { lines: [5] },
  { range: [1, 9] }
]}
/>
---
### `find`

```notes
Searches for an element that matches the conditions defined by the specified predicate,
and returns the first occurrence within the entire Observable sequence.
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="find Operator"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/find.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1] },
  { range: [3, 4] },
  { lines: [6] },
  { range: [1, 9] }
]}
/>
---
### `pipe`

```notes
pipe is a method on Observable which is used for composing operators.
pipe was introduced to RxJS in v5.5
```
---
<CodeSurfer
title="pipe Method"
dark="true"
code={require("raw-loader!./src/rx-js/pipe.es6")}
steps={[
  { lines: [1], notes: "take this code" },
  { range: [3, 6], notes: "turn it into this" },
  { range: [1, 6] }
]}
/>
---
### `pipe` Benefits

 * cleans up Observable.prototype by removing operators
 * makes the RxJS library more tree-shakeable
 * makes it easier to write and use third-party operators
