# Promises

---

"Imagine you are a kid. Your mom promises you that she'll get you a new phone next week."

You don't know if you will get that phone until next week. Your mom can either really buy you a brand new phone, or stand you up and withhold the phone if she is not happy :(.

---

That is a promise. A promise has 3 states. They are:

Pending: You don't know if you will get that phone
Fulfilled: Mom is happy, she buys you a brand new phone
Rejected: Your mom is happy, she withholds the phone

ES7 introduce async and await syntax. It makes the asynchronous syntax look prettier and easier to understand, without the .then and .catch.

# Why promises ?

---
If you add the numbers with normal function, you get the result immediately. However when you issue a remote call to get result, you need to wait, you can't get the result immediately.
